# Vaultwarden traefiked

This is my repo to keep an eye on my working configuration for my vaultwarden traefik composer working directory.

## What can be changed

Of course, if you already have traefik up and running you should adapt the middlewares !
You may want to change the network name too I called it *proxy* as I did for my traefik configuration.
The URL to access this application should be changed too ! except if you own the domain *my-domain.tld*... and have a subdomain named *sub* but that's likely not the case so change it to your domain.

So just to be clear :

- The domain
- The network name
- The middlewares

## How can you use it

Just clone this repo or the global one synology-traefiked !
Don't foget to change what you need the minimum is the domain.
